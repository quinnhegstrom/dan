<br><h2>About me</h2><p>
    Hello! My name is Dan Saiyan. I’m an artist that enjoys cartooning (mostly character art, design, and illustration).  I mainly work in Clip Studio Paint EX, but I can also work in Photoshop and Illustrator.
    <br>
    <br>
    I’m located in Middle Tennessee, and I’m 23 years old. I’ve been drawing for as long as I can remember (definitely more than a decade), and I’ve been posting on social media such as Twitter, Tumblr, DeviantART, and YouTube for at least a decade.
    <br>
    <br>
    Although I do produce a lot of fanart for my interests (mainly Dragon Ball), I do also have personal projects and take commissions from other people. I specialize in character art and character design. I’m working on improving my skills in illustration as well, especially environmental work. Although I do not take these as commissions or want to do them professionally, I’ve also done comic work and small animations. You can see my comics here and my animations here; my character art/design and illustration work can be found on my portfolio page.
    <br>
    ​<br>
    I want to go into character design as a career, and right now I am looking around for possible work!
